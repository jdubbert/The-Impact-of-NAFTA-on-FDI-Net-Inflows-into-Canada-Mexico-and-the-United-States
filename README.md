# The-Impact-of-NAFTA-on-FDI-Net-Inflows-into-Canada-Mexico-and-the-United-States
An exploratory and regression analysis of the impact of NAFTA on trade in the US, Canada and Mexico.

Research Questions:

- What is the impact of free trade agreements (FTAs) on foreign direct investment (FDI)? 
- How does NAFTA affect FDI between the US and Mexico?
- Which country has benefited the most in terms of FDI from NAFTA?

I want to study the impact that bilateral and/or multilateral free trade agreements have on foreign direct investment inflows and outflows of the involved countries. I am specifically interested in the effect of NAFTA on FDI, but will compare with other FTAs involving other countries.
